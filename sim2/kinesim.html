		<h2>The code</h2>

		<p>Run <a href="http://pro.ganil-spiral2.eu/spiral2/instrumentation/actar-tpc/actarsim-2013-package/view">this simulation</a> in <a href="{{ site.geant4_url }}">Geant4</a> with the kinematics included. The bash file <code>cine.sh</code> (in the <code>kinesim/</code> folder) can be used for this purpose.</p>

		<p>Option <code>#C</code> of this file allows to set the kinematic parameters, which tell the program to simulate a nuclear reaction and generate an output file that contains information about the energies and the angles of the projectile and the target. The output file is in ROOT format.</p>
