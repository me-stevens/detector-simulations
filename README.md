# Detector simulations

A collection of my very simple simulations, mostly gamma particle detectors.

They use CERN's [Geant4](http://geant4.cern.ch) and [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/drupal) libraries.

Please find an explanation of the simulations in the dedicated site: http://detectorsims.tk

## Sim1

A simulation of a simple gamma detector with the Geant4 libraries. 

## Sim2

A simulation of an active target with the Geant4 libraries. Includes three types of calculations.

## Sim3

A stabilization function for photo-multipliers coupled to NaI scintillators.
